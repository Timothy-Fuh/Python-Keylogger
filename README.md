This is a simple keylogging script created through Python as a capstone project for my cybersecurity bootcamp at Fullstack Academy. 
It was created to explore how malware (in this case, a keylogger) interacts with an endpoint device.
It is not meant to bypass any of the default security measures that Windows or Mac has in place.
